# Project Proposal
## Idea 1: Pacman
I want to make the standard *Pacman* game, where the goal of pacman is to eat all of the dots and not get killed by the ghosts. If I have time, maybe implement in a feature of the ghosts actually being able to folllow pacman around in the maze. Also, if I have more time then implement the "lives" system where the player will have 3 chances after pacman gets caught by the ghost. Maybe I'll also let the player continue playing pacman forever until they lose all 3 lives then at that point. 

I'll have to use a graphics library to actually display graphics so I might use: [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/), [Cocos](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/#), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/features), or [Urho3D](https://urho3d.github.io/). 

## Idea 2: Oregon Trail
My other idea is to make a game similar to *Oregon Trail* (it might be take place in a different setting though). The goal of the game is to reach the end of the trail without dying. The player will still have themselves, and other family members. If I have time, then allow the player to choose how many are in their family (1-5 members in total), gender, and age of the family members. The player must be able to gather food and water, medicine, and other goods to survive. Other goods include equipment that can be used to boost stats for the player when they're out getting food, practicing medicine, or upgrading the player's steed or wagon. Some goods can be found along the trail (by looting other player's abadon wagons) and then be sold at towns along the way. Maybe if I have time, then I can also implement in a feature where depending on if a player looted a nonabadoned wagon, then it may reward the player with some gold/goods later on. During the game, the player may experience theft, or their wagon breaking. 

The people in the player's family can also get dieases and die. The player is able to cure their family members with medicine. If the family member isn't cured within a certain number of days then they die. Family members can also help gather food, guard the wagon from theives, or fix any broken parts. But, they also consume food as well. If there is time, then I'll also implement in a mini-game for gathering food and looting other wagons. In addition, every 30 days or so the season will change and this changes how much food one can get, and how likely one can become sick. 

The player's starting profession will effect the rest of the game. The player can be:
 * Banker - start with more money, and earn money faster
 * Hunter/Gather - start with more food, and get food faster
 * Carpenter/Constructor - start with better equipment, and be able to fix things faster/have them break less often
 * Doctor - start with more medicine, and be more likely to cure family members
 * Regular Joe - starts with basics, no benefits

Similar to the *Pacman* game, I will end up using a graphics library to display graphics so I will use: [Allegro](http://liballeg.org/), [Cocos](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/#), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/features), or [Urho3D](https://urho3d.github.io/).
