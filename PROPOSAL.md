# Project Proposal

## Oregon Trail
My other idea is to make a game similar to *Oregon Trail* (it might be take place in a different setting though). The goal of the game is to reach the end of the trail without dying. The player will have themselves, and others to travel along with. The player will be able to gather food, water, and medicine to survive. The player can perform a variety of actions from buying/selling goods, killing other players, and eating/drinking.

The player's starting profession will effect the rest of the game. The player can be:
 * Banker - start with more money
 * Hunter/Gather - start with more food and water
 * Doctor - start with more medicine
 * Regular Joe - no benefits :(

I used the libraries ofxTextBlock, ofImage, and ofTrueTypeFont.
