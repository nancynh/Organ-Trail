Writing a user interface took a lot longer than I thought it would. OpenFrameworks is not that nice when it comes to taking in user input via text commands. The biggest issue with OpenFrameworks (and C++ in general) is that it's hard to modify input. For example, if the user were to input multiple spaces in between commands and then the program removed all of the extra spaces, the program would show the colorful wheel of death (aka buffering symbol on Mac). Also, another issue was being able to wrap the text back around. Thankfully, with the help of ofxTextSuite, it allowed me to define an area to have the text go back around.
